**Description:** The dataset includes reasons students were absent from Calaveras County, California before and after the pandemic. The years included in this dataset are 2017-2018 and 2022-2023. Absences were recorded by demographic groups such as race, gender, and living accommodations. Schools are listed by name and include if they are a public or charter school.
